= Minimum Requirements =
1. Nuapay Account access
1. A Nuapay Account permitting you to collect direct debits

Automatic installation is the easiest option as WordPress handles the file transfers itself and you don't need to leave your web browser. To do an automatic install of Nuapay, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu and click Add New.
In the search field type 'Nuapay' and click Search Plugins. Once you've found our eMandate plugin you can view details about it such as the version, rating and description and you can install it by simply clicking 'Install Now'.

= Manual installation =
The manual installation method involves downloading our Nuapay plugin and uploading it to your webserver via your FTP application.

= Updating =
Automatic updates should work like a charm; as always though, ensure you backup your site just in case.
If on the off-chance you do encounter issues with the mandate signing pages after an update you simply need to flush the permalinks by going to WordPress > Settings > Permalinks and hitting 'save'. That should return things to normal.
